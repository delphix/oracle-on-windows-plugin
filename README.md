# Oracle on Windows Plugin

## What Does a Delphix Plugin Do?

Delphix is a data management platform that provides the ability to securely copy and share datasets. Using virtualization, you will ingest your data sources and create virtual data copies, which are full read-write capable database instances that use a small fraction of the resources a normal database copy would require. The Delphix engine has built-in support for interfacing with certain types of datasets, such as Oracle, SQL Server and ASE.

The Delphix virtualization SDK (https://github.com/delphix/virtualization-sdk) provides an interface for building custom data source integrations for the Delphix Dynamic Data Platform. The end users can design/implement a custom plugin which enable them to use custom data source like MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, Couchbase or any other datasource similar to built-in dataset types like Oracle, SQL Server, vFiles etc with Delphix Engine.

## Oracle on Windows Plugin info
